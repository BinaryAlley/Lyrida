### Visual style

This project has drawn inspiration from the visual style and certain graphic elements of [Enlightenment](https://www.enlightenment.org/), a Window Manager, Compositor, and Minimal Desktop for Linux and other compatible UNIX systems. Their distinctive design has greatly influenced the aesthetics of this project, and I wish to express my profound appreciation for their innovative work.

Any modifications or adaptations made to the original graphics and styles are my responsibility. All rights, acknowledgments, and credits for the original design elements belong to the Enlightenment project and its contributors.
