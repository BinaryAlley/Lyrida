### Setup ###

Upon installing and running the client and the server app, you can visit the URl of the client in a browser, where you will be presented with the web page for configuring the Admin user account:

It is **strongly** recommended to enable 2FA authentication, otherwise, there will be no way to recover your account, in case you forget your password!

Once you submit the data, if you chose to enable 2FA, you will be presented with a QR code that you can scan with an authenticator app, such as Aegis Authenticator, Google Authenticator, or Authy:

Aftwerwards, you can proceed to the login page. If you enabled 2FA TOTP, after you will provide your username and password, you will be asked to enter the 6 digit code generated by the authenticator app that you used to scan the QR code when you created the account:

Once logged in, you can start adding services that will be the file system data providers of Lyrida:

Finally, when you are done setting data sources, you can click on the account icon in the top left corner, and chose "File System". This will take you to the main page where you will interact with the file explorer. Click on the "Add Tab" icon, and chose a data source from the drop down that appears:

That's it! You will be taken to the default path that you specified for that specific data source, and you can now start using the application just like any other file explorer:
